# Code Clause Fake News Detection 

Description - A king of yellow journalism, fake news is false information and hoaxes spread through social media and other online media to achieve a political agenda. In this data science project, I have used Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. I have built a TfidfVectorizer and used a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news into "Real" and "Fake".
